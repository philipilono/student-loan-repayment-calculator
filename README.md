# Student loan repayment calculator

The aim of this project is to develop a program that will calculate student loan repayments for a range of starting salaries and save results to a file. The calculator was based on the sStudent Finance calculator at : https://www.gov.uk/student-finance-calculator and further developed.

## Assumptions

- Assume figures applicable full-time UK undergraduate students
- Course has started between September 2018 and August 2019
- Placement fee is 20% of the tuition fee (as this is the max amount) 
- Maintenance loan each year is Â£8700 (maximum loan amount)
- Salary growth and inflation is at a rate of RPI + 3%

## Use and limitations

-This current tool is for students who have not yet finished their degree in order to get estimations of monthly student loan repayments. The program will produce a spreadsheet that displays all monthly repayments. 
-This current tool is not recommended for an accurate figure of monthly repaymentsbut for a reasonable estimation. Maximum figures are taken for maintenace loan to obtain a maximum repayable amount.
-The code containing the main() function will be in a file called wsa010cwk.c that calls functions.c and functions.h
